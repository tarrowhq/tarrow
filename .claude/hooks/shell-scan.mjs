// shell-scan.mjs — single-pass, quote-aware shell-word scanner for the
// root-guard hook (TASK-101 / spec 051, R2 + R5(b)).
//
// This REPLACES the defective two-regex parse in promptworld's
// root-guard-hook.mjs (`parseGitInvocation`): a boundary regex
// `/[;|&\n`)]/` and a tokenizer `/("[^"]*"|'[^']*'|\S+)/g`, both applied to
// the raw command string with NO regard for quote state. A `-m` message that
// contains a newline or a `)` truncated the segment mid-quote; the now
// unterminated `"` never matched `"[^"]*"`, so `\S+` shattered the message
// into bare words that were then read as pathspecs. The default-correct
// `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@…>` trailer carries
// BOTH hazards (a blank line and a `)`), so it reliably tripped the gate.
//
// The fix is a real single-pass scanner that tracks single-quote,
// double-quote, ANSI-C (`$'…'`), locale (`$"…"`), and backslash-escape state,
// so a separator INSIDE a quoted run is literal, never a boundary. plan.md
// rejects a lookbehind / "skip quoted runs" patch on the regexes: it passes the
// obvious tests and fails on nesting and escapes. The scanner is the design.
//
// Phase 5 (spec R2a) closed a fail-open gap: two EXECUTABLE bash forms scanned
// ok:false and so were waved through fail-open — `$'it\'s a fix'` (ANSI-C
// quoting with an escaped apostrophe) and a trailing `\` at EOF. Modeling
// `$'…'`, treating `$"…"` as a double-quoted run, and resolving a trailing
// backslash make both scan ok:true, so they are gated under policy. This
// STRICTLY TIGHTENS — it turns ok:false (allow) into ok:true (evaluate); it
// cannot make anything more permissive.
//
// Node >= 18, ESM, zero npm dependencies. Pure functions — no stdin, no fs,
// no process: unit-testable in isolation, which is the whole point of lifting
// the parse out of the hook's stdin contract.

// Separators. A separator is a command boundary ONLY outside quotes:
//
//   ;  |  &  <newline>  `(backtick)  )  (
//
// The first six match the boundary class the defective parser used
// (`[;|&\n`)]`). `(` is added so `$(git …)` / `(git …)` subshell invocations
// are seen at COMMAND POSITION — promptworld's own git-detection regex
// `/(?:^|[;&|`(\n])\s*git(?=\s|$)/` already includes `(`, so this preserves
// its behavior rather than widening policy. An unquoted `(` in a legitimate
// git command outside a subshell is effectively never seen (globs/paths are
// quoted), so treating it as a boundary is safe and strictly more correct for
// substitutions.

// the load-bearing case — a backslash-escaped apostrophe is a LITERAL `'` that
// does NOT close the run, so `$'it\'s a fix'` is the single word `it's a fix`
// (a valid, executable bash command). The named escapes below cover bash's
// common set; the two the dispatch calls out (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`) resolve to
// newline/tab/backslash. An unrecognized escape (`\x`/`\0`/`\u` numeric forms,
// or an arbitrary `\q`) resolves to the escaped character itself — a deliberate
// simplification, since the resolved value of a `$'…'` token is only ever a
// commit-message value here, never a pathspec, so exact numeric expansion is
// not load-bearing; what matters is that the run is BALANCED and scans ok:true
// so the command is gated under policy rather than waved through fail-open.

/**
 * Single-pass quote-state scanner. Splits `command` into segments — maximal
 * runs of tokens uninterrupted by an unquoted separator — with full
 * single-quote, double-quote and backslash-escape tracking.
 *
 * Token rules:
 *   - Unquoted whitespace ends the current token (but not the segment).
 *   - A quoted run accumulates into the CURRENT token: `-m "a b"` is two
 *     tokens (`-m`, `a b`), never three. `'it'\''s'` is one token (`it's`).
 *   - Separators inside any quote are literal; outside quotes they end the
 *     token AND the segment (the next token is then at command position).
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED contract: an UNBALANCED quote (single, double, or an unterminated
 * `$'…'`/`$"…"` run) makes the command unparseable. The scanner then returns
 * `{ ok: false, reason }` and NO tokens — never a partial/shattered token list.
 * An unparseable command is not an allowed command: a caller cannot mistake
 * shredded words for pathspecs (the exact original defect), because there are no
 * words to mistake. It never throws.
 *
 * A trailing backslash at EOF is NOT a failure (Phase 5): bash accepts it and
 * drops it (`README.md\` ⇒ `README.md`), so the scanner resolves it rather than
 * reporting `dangling-escape` — the former ok:false there was a fail-open hole
 * for an executable command. `dangling-escape` now signals only non-string
 * input.
 *
 * @param {string} command
 * @returns {{ok: true, segments: Array<Array<{value: string, index: number}>>}
 *          | {ok: false, reason: 'unbalanced-single-quote'
 *                              | 'unbalanced-double-quote'
 *                              | 'dangling-escape'}}
 *   On success, `segments[i]` is that segment's tokens in order; each token
 *   carries its `value` (quotes/escapes resolved) and the `index` (char
 *   offset in `command`) where the token began — Phase 3 needs the index to
 *   resolve each invocation's effective dir (`cd`/`-C` before it).
